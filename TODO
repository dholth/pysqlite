Summary:        package renaming
Priority:       highest
Status:         open
Description:
    "import sqlite2" => "import pysqlite2.dbapi2 as sqlite". This involves many
    places that need changing.

Summary:        import microprotocols from psycopg
Priority:       high
Status:         integrated, needs bugfixing and tests
Description:
    fog allowed me to reuse his microprotocols code from psycopg. He'll also
    relicense it under the zlib license so pysqlite can use it. This solves the
    conversion problem Python => SQLite

Summary:        .converters attribute of cursor
Priority:       high
Status:         open
Description:
    Type conversion SQLite => Pyhton. If pysqlite cannot detect the type, the
    user must tell it which type it is. Also if pysqlite would guess wrong, the
    user can force a certain typecast.

Summary:        cursor grows row factory
